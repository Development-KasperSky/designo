## My process

### Built with

- React library
- Styled Components
- Advance use of Flexbox & CSS Grid for styling
- React Router => Rendering of pages
- React Helmet => Dynamic search engine optimization
- Technical SEO library
- FormSpree API => Sends contact form messages
- Figma => Interprete & view designs
- Vercel => CI/CD

### What I learned

I started this project to practice React, but I soon realized I was writing the same code for every planet, since every page looks the same, and I thought there MUST be a better way. After some research - I found Nextjs. The dynamic paths seem like the solution I was looking for. That also meant a huge refactor of the entire React project.

I relied heavily on the official docs and articles to get it together. I had a lot of questions in development and looking back, I should've asked for help sooner to avoid unnecessary frustration. Nevertheless, quite proud of how the project turned out since it pushed me to add a framework to my arsenal.

### Continued development

I now understand why they say it can be difficult to add animations in React. Changes in state and the DOM make it quite tricky. It's something I'd like to delve in a little more going forward.
